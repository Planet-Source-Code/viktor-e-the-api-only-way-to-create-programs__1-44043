### Description

In some aspects it is better to program in VC++ than in VB, but these languages for sure have one thing in common - the access to the API functions. A VC++ programmer does subclassing all the time, while for the VB programmer this word sounds like the hell on earth. Well, see for yourself how you can create a functional program based on API functions and subclassing procedures, where all the controls, including the parent form, are created on-the-fly.
